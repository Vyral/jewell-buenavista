What is a CCRC and how does it differ from independent living, assisted living, and long-term care communities?

First, to recap, CCRC stands for continuing care retirement community, and **they basically combine the previous three communities we’ve talked about in our senior living options series into one.**

Many seniors prefer this option because they don’t want to have to move to an independent living community, then an assisted living community, and then (possibly) a long-term care community three separate times. In other words, if you want a senior living option where you can move in as an independent living resident and stay for the rest of your life, you need to find the right CCRC.&nbsp;

CCRCs provide all the amenities and services you need, we have plenty of beautiful CCRCs right here in San Diego, but keep in mind that **many of them require an entrance fee (or what they call a “buy-in”).** This fee can potentially allow you to pay a lower monthly living fee, and it also ensures that the community can care for you as long as necessary.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about all the available CCRCs in the San Diego area or you have any other questions about them, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
