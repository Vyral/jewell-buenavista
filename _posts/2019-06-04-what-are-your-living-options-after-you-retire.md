When you’ve retired from the workforce and are planning to enter a retirement community, you need to think about the long-term to guide your decisions, especially since, as you age, your care requirements will increase. **There are four main routes to take:**
{: .present-before-paste}

1. **Move into an independent living community**. In an independent living community, you get to retain, well, your independence. Such places have amenities for seniors and older adults, meaning that you don’t have to go far to do certain activities. They do have the option for meal plans, but you’re not required to utilize it. You can cook for yourself, make use of the laundry services, and live your life as you see fit.
2. **Move to an assisted living center.** Like I said earlier, your care needs tend to increase as you get older. It might be that you need reminding to take your medications, or it could be that taking a shower has become more difficult to do by yourself. Assisted living communities have the staff to help you with your personal care. They do assist with medication, but also with other tasks like bathing, getting dressed, and other activities of daily living.
3. **Move into a long-term care center.** These communities are for people who require 24-hour assistance, such as those who have memory impairments caused by dementia or Alzheimer’s, for example. Like an assisted living center, long-term care centers have a staff capable of providing medical assistance, physical therapy, or general care-giving. Bear in mind that residence at a long-term care center isn’t necessarily permanent; depending on your needs, yours could very well be a temporary stay.
4. **Move into a continuing care retirement community (CCRC).** In a CCRC, you can move in independently, but you’ll also be able to stay until you require long-term or until the end of life. You wouldn’t need to keep moving from community to community.

In future videos, I’ll discuss each of these living arrangements in more detail, but hopefully this helps you understand what options you have once you’ve retired.
