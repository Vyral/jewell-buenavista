Unexpected repairs present a host of challenges for some homeowners—especially for those who are seniors. Whether it’s because you’re living on a fixed income or you don’t have anyone else in the household who can lend a hand, a broken air conditioner or toilet can be more than you bargained for.&nbsp;

How can you address these issues without feeling overwhelmed?&nbsp;

Most likely, your primary concern is your finances. You wonder, “How am I going to pay for these unexpected repairs?” Before heading straight to the bank and dipping into your account, make sure to **give your insurance company a call and inquire about your coverage.** You may be pleasantly surprised to find that the repair is covered.&nbsp;

If the repair isn’t covered through insurance, your second option is to **look into your home warranty if you have one.** Not every homeowner does, but let’s talk a little about what a warranty encompasses in case you didn’t know what yours covers or you’re interested in purchasing one: &nbsp;

* **Repairs or replacement of appliances.** This includes your refrigerator, stove, microwave, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;
* **Some repairs or replacement of electrical and plumbing units.** Just last year, my water heater went out, and home warranty contractors came out to my home and replaced it at minimal cost\!

For the sake of argument, say you don’t have a home warranty. In that case, who should you call for help with repairs? A good rule of thumb is to first **ask your fellow neighbors or your friends to point you in the right direction and recommend a professional or service that they’ve used in the past. &nbsp;**

If none of these options work for your situation, **make sure that whoever you do hire for the job has received high praise from past customers in their ratings and reviews.** A quick online search or the review site Yelp\! will tell you a lot.&nbsp;

It’s just as important to **make sure that the contractor you work with is fully licensed, bonded, and insured.** The last thing you want is to be legally liable for an injury or accident on your property that you had no control over.&nbsp;

Before starting the job, your contractor should give you a quote that describes in full detail the services they’re rendering and the itemized costs to you. You don’t want there to be any uncertainty about either once the repair job is underway. &nbsp;

If you have any additional questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I hope to hear from you soon\!&nbsp;
