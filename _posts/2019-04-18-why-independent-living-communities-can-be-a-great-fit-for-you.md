Today’s video marks the first in a series about senior living options that are available in San Diego and around the country in general. **This series will have a focus primarily on independent living.**

Before we dive into independent living, let’s break down the three main options seniors have: independent living, assisted living, and long-term care communities.

To live in an independent living community, you typically have to be at least 55. Most are apartment-style residences or neighborhoods that have amenities for seniors. They’re kid-free environments, so you’re living among your peers.

**Living in an independent community is just like living in your own home.** You have your own kitchen, you don’t need an assistant, and you can basically do whatever you want. The difference is that you can find many amenities and activities in your neighborhood campus; you don’t need to drive far away to find things to do.

Some of these communities have monthly leases that include meals, laundry services, and more. For people who’ve simply had it with cooking, lawn maintenance, and other responsibilities, independent communities are a great option.&nbsp;

**Keep in mind that independent communities are not licensed by the state.** If you require any sort of medical assistance, these communities do not provide that care, so they may not be a good fit for you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Essentially, independent communities put activities, amenities, and services at your fingertips. They’re close to shopping centers, restaurants, medical areas, and other things that make living very convenient.&nbsp;
