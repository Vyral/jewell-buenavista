What’s the difference between an independent living community and an assisted living community?&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

As the name implies, **“assisted living” means these communities provide some form of personal assistance in your daily life.** This assistance isn’t necessarily medical. Rather, it refers more to day-to-day living activities, including bathing, dressing, eating, etc.&nbsp;

People can move into assisted living communities on a temporary basis and for the long term. Oftentimes, these units are smaller than independent living communities, and they can occasionally be shared units. Residents usually live there on a monthly lease, and the services you’re typically provided include meals, laundry, medication management, and nursing care. Other communities provide amenities such as spas and salons.

It’s important to remember that **not all assisted living communities are licensed** (or they’re not all licensed the same say). That’s why, if you or someone you know is planning on moving into one, you need to inquire as to what level of care they’re licensed to assist with.&nbsp;
