In continuing our discussion on senior living options, it’s time to discuss long-term and memory-based care. Before we delve into these options, let’s first define the difference between independent living, assisted living, and long-term care.

Independent living, as the name implies, is an arrangement in which a person lives on their own with little to no outside assistance. Assisted living arrangements are similar, but include occasional support from a caregiver or caregiving staff.&nbsp;

The final option is long-term care. Long-term care is best suited for those who require constant or near-constant caregiving, such as those with physical or cognitive limitations. Unlike assisted living, **long-term care is a more intensive option.** Long-term care facilities, also known as skilled nursing facilities or “nursing homes” often includes 24-hour supervision.&nbsp;

Some long-term care units allow you or your aging loved one to live alone (under the supervision of a caretaking staff), while others offer shared living spaces.&nbsp;

With all of this said, you’re probably wondering about the cost. In truth, it depends. **Many long-term care options are paid privately, while others can be covered by insurance.&nbsp;**
